Installation
------------

To run the tutor app, first install flutter `here <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install>`_ and download the latest stable release for your operating system. The Flutter SDK comes bundled with the Flutter framework, Dart SDK, and other necessary tools.

Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the zip file to a location on your machine. For example, on macOS or Linux, you can extract it to your home directory or any other preferred location.

To run Flutter commands from the terminal easily, you can add the Flutter bin directory to your system's PATH variable. This step is optional but highly recommended for convenience.

You can verify that flutter has been installed properly by typing

.. code-block:: console

   $ flutter doctor

in a terminal.

Running the project
----------------

If you're using an IDE like Android Studio or Visual Studio Code, you can run your Flutter project directly from the IDE. Look for options like "Run" or "Debug" and select your target device or emulator.

Alternatively in the terminal for the IDE run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ flutter run

and the application should open in the selected browser.
